# Short bio or description (displayed in the header)
description: After being in the education field for the past ten years, I am venturing out of the four walls of a classroom to explore new opportunities.  While finishing my degree in Education, I worked as a paraprofessional helping students with special needs.  I have gone from working in a low income charter school to a parochial school in an affluent neighborhood in Miami, Fl.  Now I am about to venture out into the unknown world of coding and seeing how I can apply to make a difference in education.
