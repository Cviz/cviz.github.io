# Here's to Trying!

As a little girl I would often speak up about my life aspirations without being asked to share them.  I would go on and on about how I would become a teacher, get married and have a family, write a book, and definitely become a missionary in order to "save the world".  You see I have always been a very determined woman.  I am now 30 years old.  I have been an educator for nine years, gone on five mission trips to Peru, have written something that is waiting to be published, and done quite a few volunteer projects.  The part about getting married, having a family, and "saving the world", I've learned is clearly out of my control.  I have always had a plan.  Hence, why I am now freaking out and my family thinks I am loosing my mind.  After being in the classroom for nine years, I am looking at venturing out into the unknown world and starting my own buisness.  Much like when I was younger, I am determined and know that I can make it happen.  The true question is how?  It is scary and I am not quite sure what I am doing.  As in the past,  I will accomplish this new dream because this part of my story I CAN control.  I have decided to start this blog to help calm my nerves and try to be a positive change for education.  Here's to trying!
