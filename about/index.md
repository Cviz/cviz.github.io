After being in the education field for the past ten years, I am venturing out of the four walls of a classroom to explore new opportunities. While finishing my degree in Education, I worked as a paraprofessional helping students with special needs. I have gone from working in a low income charter school in downtown to a parochial school located in an affluent neighborhood in Miami, Fl. Now, I am about to venture out into the unknown world of coding in hopes of making a difference in education.
